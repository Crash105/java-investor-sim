# Title: Fake Company Random Name Generator

### Description:
This task involves creating or fetching random fake company names for the companies displayed to the user on the investment page. These names will make the investment options more fun and realistic. You can either generate names within your app or use an external service to get random company names.

### Tasks:
1. **Implement a random name generator** or fetch company names from an external API:
   - You can write code that randomly generates names, or you can use a free API that provides random company names.
   - Example: Use Java's `Random` class to generate random words, or connect to a service like [RandomUser.me](https://randomuser.me/).

2. **Ensure uniqueness on each page visit**:
   - Every time the user visits the investment page, they should see 3 different companies, each with a unique name.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The user is presented with 3 randomly generated fake company names on each visit to the investment page.
- The company names are either generated within the application or fetched from an external API.
