# Title: (3) Active Investments List Page

### Description:
Create a page where users can view their **active investments**. This page should show the companies they’ve invested in, along with how much time is left until the investment outcome is determined (based on the company’s incubation time).

### Tasks:
1. **Create a list page for active investments**:
   - Display all of the user’s current investments, including the company name, incubation time, and time remaining.

2. **Calculate and display the remaining time** until the investment matures:
   - Show the user how much time is left until the outcome (profit or loss) is calculated.

3. **Link the list page to the navigation bar**:
   - Add a link to this page in the navigation bar so users can easily find it.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The user can view their active investments, including the company name and time remaining until the outcome is calculated.
- The list page shows all active investments and updates the remaining time dynamically.
